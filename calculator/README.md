# Calculator 

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the **Claculator**! ðŸŽ‰

This is a simple and fun number guessing game written in C. The objective of the game is to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100, with hints provided along the way.

## Features

- **Colorful Console Output**: The game uses ANSI color codes for an engaging user experience.
- **User-Friendly Prompts**: Clear instructions and feedback are provided for each guess.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- **Remainder**: Calculates the modulus (remainder) of two integers.
- **Power Function**: Raises a base to an exponent.
- **Square Root**: Calculates the square root of a number.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Sine, Cosine, and Tangent in degrees.
- **Logarithms**: Computes the natural logarithm of a number.
- **User-Friendly**: Includes a colorful banner and clear prompts.
- **Error Handling**: Prevents division by zero, modulus by zero, and logarithm of non-positive numbers.
